The user enters a URL and this tool returns a bit.ly-esque short link that redirects to the inputted URL.

I'm using MAMP, so the idea of a short link is sort of lost when your "domain" is "localhost:8888/link-shortener", but if you had an actually short url, like short.co, then this would be more useful.

-----SETUP-----

Easy peasy!

Copy the files into your site and set the redirect.php vars $dsn, $user, and $password to the correct values.  Use setup.sql to create the link table, or if you want to use your own modifications, make sure the edit the $stmt vars in index.php and redirect.php. Modify .htaccess based on your own directories.

This is just some practice for me, so feel free to suggest any improvements or to use in your own project.
